# Digital-clock-and-Alarm
It's a Python based project .
It will take voice commands and convert them into string inputs .
You'll be able to set an alarm and play the alarm tone of your choice as an alert .
I've also designed a GUI for a digital clock using tkinter that displays the current time and date .
